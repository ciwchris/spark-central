Agenda overview
---------------

- Find a computer
- We'll walk through what we will be using
- Make sure everyone can see the same thing on their computer
- Basic understanding of how we'll draw
- I'll show a shape, then you'll spend time to try it out, if you have questions get Erica's my attention (Repeat)
- See how far we'll get, we won't go through the whole reference
- Last 45 minutes you'll create something from what you've learned
- Perhaps share what we created
- Experiment! Try different things and see what happens. You don't need to understand everything before trying something. Just start trying.

Can be confusing, lots of ways to do accomplish the same thing
SVG: it's scable, can make the image bigger or smaller without imaging becoming blurry

Can look intimidating. But experiment to figure it out. Search for example usages.
Go through the tutorial https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial

If your serious about creating images you will use tools instead of creating everything by hand. But this gives you a foundation of important concepts.
